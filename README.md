# Prometheus-exposition-format-rs

A simple and quick Rust lib for reading exposition format.
This uses [nom](https://lib.rs/crates/nom) in an attempt to make it fast and correct.

# Disclaimer

This is my first real Rust project. So a lot of things are probably wrong or non idiomatic.
Please let me know so I can correct and learn.
